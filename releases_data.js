    "Description": "2026 Record Store Day reprise of the 1968 album 'Live' by the 13th Floor Elevators. Spurned at the time for being billed as \"Live\" when in fact it was a compilation of previously recorded studio masters, outtakes and alternate mixes. The \"very loud\" crowd noise was overdubbed and was actually taken from a boxing match and wholly inappropriate for the purpose. Now, almost 60 years on, the album masters are available, in their original sequence, without the crowd noise, to be enjoyed in their full psychedelic splendor.",

    "Format": "12\" Vinyl EP",
    "Description": "Dear Children of Our Children, I Knew is a new EP recorded by Alabaster DePlume in the middle of his March 2025 US tour. DePlume had been playing shows with bassist Shahzad Ishmaeli and drummer Tcheser Holmes, performing music of his critically-acclaimed album A Blade Because A Blade Is Whole (released March 2025). The trio's rapport was so strong that DePlume chose to use an off day in Brooklyn to record this collection of instrumentals, which were inspired by experiences he had sharing, performing and improvising off the music of A Blade for audiences across the US. Dear Children in a sense serves as an epilogue to A Blade, which makes it all the more appropriate that the B side of its RSD-exclusive vinyl release contains the three song EP Cremisan: Prologue to A Blade, which was released (digital only) in fall 2024. As with almost everything that DePlume has put forth in recent years, the connection of this work to Palestine is deep: the Cremisan EP itself was recorded in Palestine; Dear Children includes samples of children recorded in Bethlehem; and the album's cover art depicts wheatpaste posters of a drawing made by a 13 year old boy from Gaza (used with permission).This is a Record Store Day 2026 exclusive.",

    "Label": "Nature Sounds",

    "Description": "By 2006, influential Harlem rapper Camron had ascended to hip-hops upper echelon. Fresh off two wildly successful Roc-A-Fella Records releases and at the forefront of the burgeoning Dipset movement, Cam had established himself as a towering figure in the culture, celebrated for his impeccable wordplay while also making waves in film and fashion. It was in this moment that Camron returned with Killa Season, shooting up to #2 on the Billboard 200 with an impressive album that remains a standout in his historic catalog. A follow-up to the gold-selling classic Purple Haze, the collection finds Killa Cam thriving over hypnotic soul samples, epic horns, dramatic strings, and an ever-present percussive foundation. While Cams relentlessly inventive lyricism is undoubtedly the main attraction, Killa Season also features appearances by Lil Wayne, Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and Max B, plus production by The Heatmakerz, Alchemist, Ty Fyffe, Charlemagne, and more. Now, this Camron masterpiece is available on vinyl for the first time ever, with this limited 2LP Red colored pressing exclusively for Record Store Day 2026.",

Cosmogramma blended jazz improvisation with cosmic textures, and is rightly regarded as one of the greatest electronic albums of all time. Subsequent albums like Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and Youre Dead! (2014) showcased his growing ambition.

In 2019, he released Flamagra, an expansive and cinematic album featuring Anderson .Paak, Tierra Whack, and David Lynch. It further solidified his reputation as a producer who creates immersive worlds rather than just albums.",

    "Description": "FOLLOWING THE SUCCESS OF \"THE OTHER HELL\", RELEASED ON RECORD STORE DAY 2025, GOBLIN ARE BACK WITH AN EXCLUSIVE COMPILATION OF SINGLES RELEASED BETWEEN 1975 AND 1979! For the very first time on vinyl, this compilation gathers together all the singles released by Goblin during their golden era between 1975 and 1979, a journey that begins with the explosive, legendary debut Profondo Rosso, a true chart phenomenon of its time, and reaches the rare Amo Non Amo, passing through unforgettable milestones of Italian film music and progressive rock. The collection opens with Profondo Rosso and Death Dies, taken from the soundtrack of Dario Argento's masterpiece that catapulted Goblin to fame, blending dark atmospheres, virtuosity, and a unique sense of cinematic tension. It continues with Roller drawn from the instrumental album Roller (1976), a record not tied to any film yet considered a cult cornerstone of Italian progressive music for its intricate structures and expressive power. Chi? (Part One and Part Two) follows; two tracks originally composed as the theme for a 1976 RAI television show, which saw Goblin bring their unmistakable sound to a different medium, experimenting within a shorter, punchier format. Next comes Suspiria followed by its haunting counterpart Blind Concert, from the soundtrack of Argento's 1977 horror classic. This remains one of Goblin's most iconic and unsettling works, where music becomes an active narrative force: hypnotic, percussive, and filled with eerie vocal layers that made it a cornerstone of horror soundtracks worldwide. From Il Fantastico Viaggio del Bagarozzo Mark (1978) come Un Ragazzo d'Argento and Opera Magnifica, two tracks that highlight the band's more conceptual and visionary side, a move away from cinema toward a self-contained narrative and progressive experimentation. The single Yell stands as another late-decade gem. Originally composed as the opening theme for the RAI television series \"Sette storie per non dormire\" (1978), it captures Goblin's ability to merge rock energy with electronic pulse, proving their versatility far beyond the horror realm. The compilation closes with Amo Non Amo and Funky Top, taken from the soundtrack of the 1979 film Amo Non Amo, one of the group's lesser known but fascinating cinematic works. Far more than a simple anthology, The Singles Collection 1975-1979 maps the evolution of Goblin's sound, from the worldwide success of Profondo Rosso to their most mature and experimental phase. It finally restores to vinyl a body of work that had long been scattered across rare 45 rpm releases, offering fans and collectors a complete, vivid portrait of one of Italy's most inventive and influential musical ensembles.

From government corruption (\"Wasteland of the Free\") to working-class struggle (\"Quality Time\"), she gives voice to the disillusioned with searing honesty and soulful grit. Merle Haggard lends his iconic vocals to This Kind of Happy, bringing a warm, lived-in authenticity that deepens the albums emotional core.Yet for all its pointed critique, The Way I Should is just as powerful in its quieter moments. Songs like \"When My Mornin Comes Around\" and \"Keep Me God\" shimmer with grace, hope, and an unwavering moral compass. DeMents unmistakable voice anchors every track with a sense of authenticity thats rare and resonant.The Way I Should isnt just an artistic evolution; its a fearless statement from a singular voice in American music. Timeless in message and rich in heart, it remains one of DeMents most compelling and relevant works.In celebration of the albums 30th anniversary, Yep Roc Records is pressing The Way I Should on vinyl for the first time.

They were mixed and engineered by Sam Gannon with additional recording engineered by Scott Holingsworth and mastered by Alex Wharton at Abbey Road Studios.

Each of the nine mixes has been radically altered, slowed down and extended, ranging from 5 to upwards of 23 minutes, allowing for the musical soundtrack to wash over the listener and provide a relaxing, immersive, deep listening and meditative experience. Four of the tracks are presented as Binaural Beat versions that each focus on different types of brain waves: Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Theta. Dubbed Real, You, Feeling, and Knowing, these tracks feature a Binaural Beat, an auditory illusion created within the brain when the left and right ears hear two slightly different frequencies whose difference is perceived as a new frequency which can activate different brain patterns for scientifically proven therapeutic effects. Beta waves occur when thinking, Delta waves are produced when completely relaxed in deep sleep, Gamma waves are associated with high levels of thought and focus, and Theta waves are produced while sleeping or daydreaming.JOHN LENNON LOVE MEDITATION MIXES Love Meditation Mixes is a Limited Edition 3 LP set produced by Sean Ono Lennon, available on Available on iridescent Pearl Arctic 180g transparent vinyl in a triple gatefold lilac mirrorboard sleeve.

The second half showcased a more expansive sound, as she was joined by a four-piece string quartet and a choir to perform her latest album, Patterns in repeat, in its entirety.the album will be released as a double lp, marking the first time these live recordings have ever been made available on a physical format. this release is particularly significant as it not only includes beloved tracks from marlings earlier catalogue but also offers a powerful, live reinterpretation of her newest workan album deeply personal and centered around her experience of motherhood.the combination of the unique live setting, the rare arrangements, and the emotional weight of the new material provides a compelling reason for the release, serving both as a document of a special musical event and a celebration of a pivotal chapter in marlings artistic journey.",

Following the release of their acclaimed memoir Fallopian Rhapsody (Hachette Books), the band stormed back with their first live shows in 17 years--headlining the main stage at Punk Rock Bowling 2021, followed by sold-out shows at Webster Hall and a slot in the CBGB Fest lineup with Iggy Pop.From the stage to the page, the Lunachicks' story continues with the upcoming documentary Pretty Ugly: The Story of the Lunachicks, directed by Ilya Chaiken and slated for theatrical release in spring 2026, and this Record Store Day release, the first-ever best-of compilation, We Can Be Worster.Throughout the '90s and early '00s, the Lunachicks' hard-hitting hooks, gritty guitars, and pounding beats earned them a cult following stretching from the Bowery to Tokyo. Formed as teenagers at NYC's famed LaGuardia High School, the band set out to conquer the world like their idols The Ramones, Black Sabbath, Kiss, The Clash, and Blondie. After cutting their teeth at legendary clubs like CBGB and The Limelight, they caught the attention of Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, leading to their 1990 debut Babysitters on Acid on London's Blast First Records.With each release, the Lunachicks gleefully dumped technicolor chaos on propriety, morality, and the patriarchy--but it was their live shows that cemented their legacy. A riot of wigs, costumes, makeup, and blaring guitars, their performances were equal parts spectacle, satire, and sheer musical power.Lunachicks released five studio albums, a live record, countless singles and videos, and appeared in films and compilations. They've shared stages with The Ramones, Iggy Pop, Joan Jett, No Doubt, Rancid, NOFX, Buzzcocks, and The Go-Go's.Today, Theo (vocals), Gina (guitar), Squid (bass), and Chip (drums) remain a fearless, ferocious quartet-still loud, smart, and gloriously unhinged.",

With that amazing voice, Emmylou, now more than ever, seems to capture a kind of universal female experience, something that speaks to all ages.

This was the end of the idea of me being a sort of cult artist at the fringes of the mainstream. There wasnt an option to go and hide in the shadows anymore.Exclusive for Record Store Day 2026, Peter Gabriels Sledgehammer single is being re-issued to celebrate its 40th anniversary. The music replicates the original Sledgehammer 12 release but comes as a zoetrope picture disc, using images taken from the ground-breaking video.",

Surely, with Dre as executive producer and guest shots from Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Dre himself, Xzibit was virtually assured of acquiring the mainstream success that eluded him on previous efforts (At The speed Of Life 40 dayz & 40 nightz). Thanks largely to Dre's knob-twisting input, Restless became aural kin to Dre's own 2001 comeback vehicle, as the head-nod factor is immediately established on \"Front To Back,\" the heavenly synth stabs \"X,\" and \"Get Your Walk On.\"Tthe main flaw in Restless' formula lies primarily with Xzibit's extensive list of guest collaborators. While contributions from Dre (\"U Know\"), Snoop (\"D.N.A.\"), and Eminem (\"Don't Approach Me\") are all welcomed, appearances from DJ Quik and KRS-One, among many others, take the focus off Xzibit's formidable lyrical boasting, which precludes restless from forming a desired level of cohesiveness. On \"X,\" Xzibit pledges to \"rearrange the game with my rugged sound,\" and he periodically delivers on that promise. However, it would have taken nothing short of a masterpiece for Xzibit to appease hip-hop's finicky masses. Marble blue vinyl.",

Thanks largely to Dre's knob-twisting input, Restless became aural kin to Dre's own 2001 comeback vehicle, as the head-nod factor is immediately established on \"Front To Back,\" the heavenly synth stabs \"X,\" and \"Get Your Walk On.\"Tthe main flaw in Restless' formula lies primarily with Xzibit's extensive list of guest collaborators. While contributions from Dre (\"U Know\"), Snoop (\"D.N.A.\"), and Eminem (\"Don't Approach Me\") are all welcomed, appearances from DJ Quik and KRS-One, among many others, take the focus off Xzibit's formidable lyrical boasting, which precludes restless from forming a desired level of cohesiveness. On \"X,\" Xzibit pledges to \"rearrange the game with my rugged sound,\" and he periodically delivers on that promise. However, it would have taken nothing short of a masterpiece for Xzibit to appease hip-hop's finicky masses. Marble blue vinyl.<br><br>",
